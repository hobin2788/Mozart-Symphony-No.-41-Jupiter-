# A. Mozart Symphony No. 41, "Jupiter""

Hello, This is Hobin-Son, and now, I will described for history of western music 
Mozart's Jupiter Symphony (Symphony No. 41 in C major, K. 551) is his final symphony and is considered one of his most majestic and grand works. The name "Jupiter" was not given by Mozart himself but was later attributed by critics due to the symphony’s grandeur and divine qualities. In Roman mythology, Jupiter is the king of the gods, and this name aligns well with the symphony's monumental character.
